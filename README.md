 Unit 3 Project--Interactive Form

# Development Journal
- Day 0:
  I'm going to begin development with Unobtrusive JS in mind, meaning designing and developing the form to work perfecting and comfortable with JS disabled. This is because JS (as powerful as it is) seems to be a common single point of failure.

  Here's a thought, how about using CSS to hide and show T-Shirt Info options instead of JS. This may be out of the scope of this project...
  Yup, it is. Don't get caught up on a design feature for bragging right. It's too early for that.

  Progressive enhancement reqs:
    The “Other” text field under the "Job Role" section should be visible
    All information for Bitcoin, PayPal or Credit Card payments should be visible.

  Encouraged CSS 'sugar':
    color,
    background color,
    font,
    transitions,
    animations,
    box shadows,
    text shadows

  CSS goal for this project:
    Night/Day Mode themes. Yes!


# Todo:
- css/reset.css or css/normalize.css - This is not a project requirement, but using a reset or normalize CSS file is an important common standard in web development as it helps zero out the initial styles that different browsers add to their page by default. So you are encouraged to take this extra step. You should be able to find what you need with a Google search.
