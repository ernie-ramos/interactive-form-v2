# Unit 3 Project--Interactive Form

In this project, I have used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I have added my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

- adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
- validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

By completing this project, I have gained a solid foundational knowledge of using and customizing forms in my projects. This is tremendously valuable since forms are a major aspect of most web sites and web applications, which makes this project a key addition to my portfolio, and a crucial step on my journey to becoming a professional full stack web developer.
