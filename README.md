 Unit 3 Project--Interactive Form

# Real-time Error Messages
Rather than providing an error message on submit, the form checks for errors and display messages as the user begins typing inside a text field. The error appears as the user begins to type, and disappears as soon as the user has entered a complete and correctly formatted input.


# Todo:
- css/reset.css or css/normalize.css - This is not a project requirement, but using a reset or normalize CSS file is an important common standard in web development as it helps zero out the initial styles that different browsers add to their page by default. So you are encouraged to take this extra step. You should be able to find what you need with a Google search.
